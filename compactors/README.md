# Dirt Compactors

## Equipment Overview
Electromechanical compaction equipment used in construction and landscaping
applications. These tools integrate gasoline-powered engines, mechanical drive
systems, and operator controls to deliver controlled vibratory compaction.

## Maintenance Performed
- Inspected ignition, fuel delivery, and air intake systems for proper operation
- Replaced spark plugs as required to restore reliable engine ignition
- Cleaned and replaced air filters to ensure proper airflow and engine performance
- Inspected engine oil levels and condition and verified levels were within operating range
- Examined drive belts and mechanical linkages for wear, damage, or tearing
- Cleaned equipment and inspected moving components for debris or obstruction
- Performed routine preventive maintenance to ensure safe and reliable operation

## Verification
- Conducted functional testing under normal operating conditions
- Verified engine startup, throttle response, and consistent compaction behavior
- Confirmed vibration mechanisms and controls operated smoothly
- Ensured equipment met safety and operational requirements before return to service
