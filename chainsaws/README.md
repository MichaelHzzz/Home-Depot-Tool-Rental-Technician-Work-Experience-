- Replaced spark plugs to restore reliable engine ignition and startup
- Cleaned and replaced air filters to ensure proper airflow and engine performance
- Removed and replaced worn or damaged chains to restore safe and effective cutting
- Inspected guide bars, chain tension, and lubrication systems for proper operation
- Cleaned cutting components and removed debris buildup
- Performed routine preventive maintenance to ensure safe and reliable operation

## Verification
- Conducted functional testing after maintenance
- Verified engine startup, throttle response, and idle behavior
- Confirmed proper chain movement, tension, and lubrication during operation
- Ensured safety features and operator controls functioned as intended
